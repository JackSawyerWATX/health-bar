# HealthBar Component

This project contains a simple React component, `HealthBar`, which visually represents a player's health in a game. The health is displayed as a green bar, and the width of the bar corresponds to the current health value, which is managed using React's `useState` hook.

## Features

- Displays a green health bar that adjusts its width based on the player's health.
- The health starts at 100% and can be modified dynamically.
- The component is styled with inline CSS for simplicity, with rounded corners for the health bar.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Run the project:

    npm start

## Usage

To use the HealthBar component in your project:

import HealthBar from './HealthBar';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Player Health</h1>
      <HealthBar />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

## Future Improvements

    Add dynamic health changes based on game events.
    Customize the health bar color to reflect different statuses (e.g., yellow for low health, red for critical health).


This `README.md` provides an overview of the component, installation steps, usage instructions, and potential improvements for future development.
